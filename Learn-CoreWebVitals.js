Core Web Vitals are a set of metrics introduced by Google to evaluate and ensure a website's user experience, focusing on performance, responsiveness, and visual stability. 
In React.js, optimizing Core Web Vitals is crucial for improving SEO and user satisfaction.

The three main metrics are:

1) Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): Measures the loading performance of the largest element visible in the viewport (e.g., an image or text block).
Aim: < 2.5 seconds
Optimization tips:
Use React.lazy() for lazy loading components.
Optimize images and use next-gen formats like WebP.
Minimize JavaScript execution by code-splitting.

2) First Input Delay (FID): Measures interactivity, i.e., the time it takes for a page to become interactive after the user first interacts with it.
Aim: < 100ms
Optimization tips:
Avoid large JavaScript bundles.
Use useMemo and useCallback to optimize re-rendering.
Reduce third-party scripts and dependencies.

3) Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): Measures visual stability by tracking unexpected layout shifts while the user interacts with the page.
Aim: < 0.1
Optimization tips:
Set explicit width and height attributes for images and videos.
Avoid inserting dynamic content above existing content without user interaction.
Use CSS for animations rather than JavaScript.
  
Tools for Measuring Core Web Vitals in React.js:
Lighthouse: Run audits in Chrome DevTools or via the Lighthouse CI tool.
Web Vitals Library: Use Google's Web Vitals library to track these metrics in your React app.
